			<a id="Mexico"></a><h4>Coca-Cola's Mexico R&amp; Center Focuses on Recipe Innovations'</h4>
			<p>A new Research and Development (R&amp;D) Center in Mexico City will fuel The Coca-Cola Company’s innovation pipeline for new ingredients, beverages, sweeteners, sustainable packaging and eco-friendly cooler technologies for the Latin America region and beyond. The state-of-the-art facility will employ 100 Coca-Cola associates from around the world.“From this center, we will work to bring new products and formulas that respond to the changing needs of Mexican consumers and consumers across Latin America – including low- and no-calorie options – through reformulation and portfolio innovation,” James Quincey, president and chief operating officer of The Coca-Cola Company, said last week at a ceremony commemorating the opening. Francisco Crespo, president of Coca-Cola Mexico, said the center supports the company’s efforts to provide consumers with additional beverage choices – including low- and no-calorie options and a range of package sizes. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who toured the facility with several members of his cabinet and Coca-Cola executives, applauded the company for responding to his administration’s request for the private sector to support efforts that promote the wellbeing of Mexico’s communities.</p>

			<a id="Formula"></a><h4>10 Years Strong: Coca-Cola’s Venturing &amp; Emerging Brands Takes on New Territory</h4>
			<p>Bringing a new product to market is challenging, risky and requires significant time and investment. Product breakthroughs often come from entrepreneurs – small, nimble teams with a different way of thinking and quick ways of adapting. In the mid 2000s, The Coca-Cola Company realized that most of the disruptive growth in non-alcoholic beverages was coming from small- to mid-size companies. That helped lead to the idea to create a new unit in Coca-Cola North America (CCNA), solely focused on identifying and nurturing innovative new brands. They would have the ability to move quickly, failing fast when necessary. In 2007, the Venturing &amp; Emerging Brands (VEB) team was born. “A third of industry growth every five years was being generated from creation of things like energy drinks, enhanced waters, protein drinks—we were in many of these emerging categories, but we wanted to focus on ways to get in even earlier,” said Matthew Mitchell, vice president of investments and ventures for VEB. This required a new approach to innovation. “CCNA was coming up with some really good and exciting ideas, and we had a lot of great innovations in our pipeline between 2001 and 2007,” said Mitchell, who has been with VEB for 10 years and Coca-Cola for 22. The challenge was that the company didn’t always have the right models to win in a fast-changing marketplace. “We used our traditional distribution and production methodologies, but disruptive ideas required a different model,” Mitchell said. Today, VEB wears four different hats. First, VEB focuses on the future, identifying longer-term consumer opportunities. Then, they put on a venture capital hat, which means deciding where to make investments. Third, VEB acts as an incubator, bringing brands to market – or to a wider market. Finally, in the integrator role, VEB aims to “graduate” successful brands out of VEB into Coca-Cola’s larger portfolio.</p>

<a id="Stevia"></a><h4>How PURECIRCLE is Investing in Growing Stevia – and Farmer Incomes – Sustainably</h4>
	<p>I’ve just arrived at Silvio Pettirosi Airport in the capital city of Asunción, in Paraguay. Mariano Demaria, who leads PureCircle Paraguay, is here to greet me. Together we will make the long journey to the stevia fields in Rio Verde, in the Northern region of the country. It’s only about 100 miles from Asunción, but it can take us over four hours – first by car before the roads get too rough and then we must switch to an ATV to navigate the distinctly, rich red clay-like dirt roads.  It’s beautiful here – hot and moist and the sun is beating down on my head. I wish I had remembered to bring my hat. My discomfort aside, it does make for ideal year-round growing conditions for stevia. We have been working with hundreds of small- scale farmers here for many years, and I am always impressed by the warm yet reserved welcome of the people here. I can feel a sense of pride as they walk me through their stevia fields and show me all they have accomplished in the latest planting and harvesting season. I want to check on a new stevia variety we are growing here. We’ve been looking at how the plant does in the different soil conditions around the world and so far we’ve been making some incredible strides in Paraguay. But my main focus for this week is to meet prospective new farmers and to hear about the progress we are making in recruiting new farmers to join us in our mission to make stevia available to millions around the world. Although the stevia plant is native to Paraguay, it is quite difficult to find farmers with the knowledge and skills to successfully grow stevia, as well as the willingness to take a risk and try something new. It’s why we have invited a group of prospective stevia farmers to our nurseries in Guayaiví, where our agronomists show them the type of support that we provide for them to be successful—everything from how to plant seedlings and use other growing materials we provide, the best way to irrigate their land, and how to reduce unnecessary waste. We will introduce them to the 7030 program, a collaboration between PureCircle and Paraguayan Ministry of Agriculture, which provides financial assistance and critical equipment to support small-scale farmers. Through this program, a first-year farmer can receive significantly greater income compared to other crops, resulting in substantial improvements in the standard of living for these farmers and their families.</p>

<a id="Japan"></a><h4>Making A (Yearly) Splash: How Coca-Cola Japan Stays Ahead in One of the Most Innovative Beverage Markets in the World</h4>
	<p>Not all billion-dollar brands are created equal—at least those of us in the western world don’t often recognize them as such. Coca-Cola’s leap outside the soda industry and into the fast-growing categories of tea, juice, sports drinks and even dairy has built an ever-expanding collection of increasingly well-known beverages that continue to conglomerate under the umbrella of a company that for a long time was known only for its signature soft drinks. We know Powerade and Simply. People are getting to know fairlife. But Aquarius? Georgia Coffee? Sokenbicha? Few Americans have heard of them, yet each of those has hit the billion-dollar mark at some point in the last five years. And Japanese consumers were the original inspiration behind the creation of all these brands. In fact, the island across the Pacific Ocean has long been one of The Coca-Cola Company’s most fast-moving and inventive markets. The Japanese business unit released about 100 new products into the market last year alone. Some are brand new, others are fresh flavors and variations of popular favorites from years past. “The Japanese consumer is very prompt to react very quickly to trends and to try new things,” says Khalil Younes, executive vice president of marketing and new businesses at Coca-Cola Japan. “In terms of what the Japanese are looking for, it’s some kind of… differentiation.” This makes for a very keen consumer. In a market saturated with products and media, Japanese people intentionally seek out products that have made some sort of improvement on the last beverage that made a splash—whether it be in flavor, health benefits, or even the way it’s advertised. “There is always a more perfect way of doing things according to the Japanese psyche,” Younes says. “It’s applied to everything—to self-perfection, agriculturally, industrially, to everything. And it applies, obviously, to products. It’s not acceptable in Japan to have a product that doesn’t evolve and get more perfect.” Low- or no-sugar drinks account for 62 percent of Coke's portfolio in Japan, and these beverages accounted for 92 percent of Coca-Cola Japan's unit case volume growth in Japan in 2016.</p><a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/making-a-yearly--splash-how-coca-cola-japan-stays-ahead" class="btn btn-default">Read More</a>
<a id="Germany"></a><h4>Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Scores Big in Germany with Football Marketing Campaign</h4>
	<p>It’s no secret that consumers have discerning taste buds, especially when it comes to their beverages. It’s a study in science and human behavior that is core to the industry’s innovation and marketing. So when The Coca-Cola Company faced a challenge in Germany winning mass appeal for a new sugar-free product, it went straight to the big leagues. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar launched in Germany in 2006, providing a no-calorie, no-sugar alternative to traditional Coca-Cola. Despite a demand for this type of beverage, many consumers didn’t realize Coke Zero was, in fact, sugar free. So, in 2013, the company temporarily sidelined Coca-Cola Classic to put Coke Zero in the starting lineup of one of the most beloved sports in Germany: football (or as Americans call it—soccer). Germany’s Bundesliga football league attracts the highest stadium attendance in the world, and offers marketers a massive landscape for elevating brands. In fact, 52 million Germans—roughly 65 percent of the population—are football fans. For Coca-Cola Germany, Bundesliga is its largest annual sponsorship marketing asset and, for years, was the platform to promote Coca-Cola’s flagship product. Shifting gears three years ago to make Coca-Cola Zero Sugar the marquee brand for Bundesliga was a twist on traditional marketing. For the first time in the league’s long-standing relationship with Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was the standout in packaging and advertisements that supported the league sponsorship throughout the country. To help consumers understand that “Zero” means zero sugar, the brand enlisted Manuel Neuer—often considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world— as Coca-Cola brand ambassador in 30-second TV spots. The commercials and, Neuer’s endorsement, served to remind consumers of their options in choosing beverages that reduce the amount of added sugar in their diets.</p>

<a id="fountain"></a><h4>Reinventing the Fountain Experience: Coca-Cola Freestyle Hits 40,000 Installs, Continues to Innovate</h4>
	<p>Since hitting the market in 2009, Coca-Cola Freestyle has reinvented the fountain beverage experience by offering an unprecedented array of drink choices in a fun, interactive format. And the sleek, touchscreen-operated dispensers are boosting guest traffic and beverage sales in restaurants, cinemas, amusement parks, convenience stores and other Coca-Cola customers across North America and a handful of other countries. While traditional fountains offer between six and eight choices, Coca-Cola Freestyle uses micro-dosing technology to deliver more than 150 sparkling and still beverages on demand, including more than 70 low/no-calorie options and 90-plus caffeine-free selections. Coca-Cola Freestyle offers a variety of drinks for every taste, lifestyle and occasion – including more than 80 brands that can’t be found anywhere else. The Freestyle distribution footprint has doubled in size since 2014 and shows no signs of slowing down. More than 40,000 units are currently serving a combined 14 million 8-ounce drinks per day, and machines are being installed each week in new markets and channels. The team also continues to push the innovation envelope with new equipment models, marketing, brands and more. We caught up with Coca-Cola Freestyle leads Joel Bishop and Chris Hellmann for an update on initial results, recent developments and the road ahead. Bishop: First, we’re doing a better job understanding how Coca-Cola Freestyle can uniquely enhance our customers’ brands and their guests’ experience. We’re leveraging Freestyle not just as a fountain dispenser, but as a true marketing asset customers can can use to build their business. We’re also continuing to look for ways to innovate and enhance Coca-Cola Freestyle experience and develop solutions that fit with our customers’ concepts. Hellman: Our latest innovation, the Coca-Cola Freestyle 7000, is a great example. It’s a smaller countertop dispenser that brings the Freestyle experience to mid-volume customers – sandwich shops, mom-and-pops and the like. We’ve installed 1,500 of these self-contained units, which offer 80 beverage choices (compared to 150 for the flagship model) and, importantly for these customers, drive operational efficiencies. We’re currently testing two more dispensers internationally. Importantly, the same consumer interface is used across the entire fleet, and all Coca-Cola Freestyle machines use micro-dosing technology. This ensures consistency of the user experience and superior beverage quality and great taste our fans love. We’re also bringing new brands and categories to the platform.</p>
