			<a id="Coca-Cola"></a><h4>Coca-Cola</h4>
			<p>Coca-Cola is the most popular and biggest-selling soft drink in history, as well as one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia, by Dr. John S. Pemberton, Coca-Cola was first offered as a fountain beverage at Jacob's Pharmacy by mixing Coca-Colasyrup with carbonated water. Coca-Cola was patented in 1887, registered as a trademark in 1893 and by 1895 it was being sold in every state and territory in the United States. In 1899, The Coca-Cola Company began franchised bottling operations in the United States and in 1906 bottling operations for Coca-Cola began to expand internationally. Coca-Cola is the most popular and biggest-selling soft drink in history, as well as one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia, by Dr. John S. Pemberton, Coca-Cola was first offered as a fountain beverage at Jacob's Pharmacy by mixing Coca-Colasyrup with carbonated water. Coca-Cola (often referred to simply as Coke) is a carbonated soft drink[1] produced by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves. The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.

The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Zero, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of 2015, Coca-Cola was the world's third most valuable brand. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers downing more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.[3]</p>

			<a id="Sprite"></a><h4>Sprite</h4>
			<p>Introduced in 1961, Sprite is the world's leading lemon-lime flavored soft drink. Sprite is sold in more than 190 countries and ranks as the No. 3 soft drink worldwide. Sprite is a colorless, caffeine-free, lemon and lime-flavoured soft drink created by The Coca-Cola Company. It was first developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (“Clear Lemon Fanta”) and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up. Bottles of Sprite are usually a transparent green colour with a green and yellow label whereas cans are coloured silver, green, blue and aluminum bottles are coloured a solid lime green. Though often confused with Lemonade, Sprite stands in separate class of carbonated soft drink.</p>
<a id="Fanta"></a><h4>Fanta</h4>
	<p>Introduced in 1940, Fanta is the second oldest brand of The Coca-Cola Company and our second largest brand outside the US. Fanta Orange is the leading flavor but almost every fruit grown is available as a Fanta flavor somewhere.  Consumed more than 130 million times every day around the world, consumers love Fanta for its great, fruity taste. Fanta originated as a result of difficulties importing Coca-Cola syrup into Nazi Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo. To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH) during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including whey and apple pomace – the "leftovers of leftovers", as Keith later recalled. The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to "use their imagination" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted "Fanta!"</p>
<a id="Diet"></a><h4>Diet Coke</h4>
	<p>Diet Coke, also known as Coca-Cola light in some markets, is a sugar- and calorie-free soft drink. It was first introduced in the United States on August 9, 1982, as the first new brand since 1886 to use the Coca-Cola Trademark. Today, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola light is one of the largest and most successful brands of The Coca-Cola Company, available in more than 150 markets around the world.When Tab was released in 1963, the Coca-Cola Company refused to release a diet soda with the Coca-Cola name, fearing that its flagship brand might suffer. Its rival Pepsi had no such qualms, and after the long-term success of its sugar-free Diet Pepsi (launched in 1964) became clear, Coca-Cola decided to launch a competing sugar-free brand under the Coca-Cola name, which could be marketed more easily than Tab. Diet Coke does not use a modified form of the Coca-Cola recipe, but instead an entirely different formula. The controversial New Coke, introduced in 1985, used a version of the Diet Coke recipe that contained high fructose corn syrup and had a slightly different balance of ingredients. In 2004, Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola C2, which it claims tastes much closer to Coca-Cola but contains half the carbohydrates. In 2005, the company introduced Coca-Cola Zero, a sugar-free variation of regular Coca-Cola.</p>
<a id="Zero"></a><h4>Coca-Cola Zero</h4>
	<p>Coke Zero was Coca-Cola's largest product launch in 22 years and launched in 2005, reaching billion-dollar status in 2007. Coca-Cola Zero offers great Coke taste, uplifting refreshment and zero sugar. Coca-Cola Zero, also called Coke Zero, is a low-calorie cola produced by The Coca-Cola Company.[1] It is specifically marketed to men, who were shown to associate diet drinks with women. It is marketed as having a taste that is indistinguishable from standard Coca-Cola, as opposed to Diet Coke which has a different flavor profile. Coca-Cola Zero is being renamed to Coca-Cola Zero Sugar (also known as Coca-Cola No Sugar in some countries) and is being reformulated to taste more like standard Coca-Cola. The new formulation was introduced in the United Kingdom in April 2016, with plans to roll it out in other countries in the following months.[6][7]</p>
<a id="Life"></a><h4>Coca-Cola Life</h4>
	<p>Coca-Cola Life is a reduced-calorie cola sweetened with cane sugar and stevia leaf extract.
	At 60 calories per 8-oz. glass bottle, Coca-Cola Life has 35 percent fewer calories than other leading colas*.
	Stevia, a sweetener with zero calories, is obtained from the leaf of the stevia plant. Together with cane sugar, stevia leaf extract gives Coca-Cola Life its delicious, sweet flavor. Coca-Cola Life is the perfect refreshing beverage to enjoy throughout summer’s sweetest moments and pairs well with some of your favorite seasonal dishes.</p>
<a id="Dasani"></a><h4>Dasani</h4>
	<p>Pure, crisp DASANI delivers fresh taste with a clean, fresh style. DASANI DROPS is the vibrant and delicious drop that transforms everyday moments into something deliciously fun, unexpected and colorful. A refreshing duo. Dasani (/dəˈsɑːni/) is a brand of bottled water from the Coca-Cola company, launched in 2002, after the success of Aquafina (produced by Coca-Cola-rival PepsiCo). It is one of many brands of Coca-Cola bottled water sold around the world. The product is filtered tap water bottled from local sources with added trace minerals. Coca-Cola uses tap water from local municipal water supplies, filters it using the process of reverse osmosis, and adds trace amounts of minerals, including magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), potassium chloride and table salt (sodium chloride).

Coca-Cola announced they would be distributing Dasani water in new packaging made of 30% plant based materials. Unlike other plant-based packaging, the bottles are compatible with standard recycling plants and represent up to a 25% reduction in carbon emissions when compared to standard water bottles, though this still represents 2000 times the energy usage of tap water.[3]

</p>
<a id="Minute"></a><h4>Minute Maid</h4>
	<p>Minute Maid has been making juice for more than 60 years and has a heritage of nutrition, innovation, and quality.  In 1945, the U.S. Army ordered 500,000 pounds of powdered orange juice from the Florida Foods Corporation, which later renames itself to Vacuum Foods and then finally the Minute Maid Corporation. The Minute Maid Corporation was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company in 1960, marking its first venture outside of soft drinks. Minute Maid is a product line of beverages, usually associated with lemonade or orange juice, but which now extends to soft drinks of many kinds, including Hi-C. Minute Maid is sold under Cappy brand in Central Europe and under Fruitopia in Norway.

Minute Maid was the first company to market orange juice concentrate, allowing it to be distributed throughout the United States and served year-round. The Minute Maid company is owned by The Coca-Cola Company, and is the world's largest marketer of fruit juices and drinks. The firm opened its headquarters in Sugar Land Town Square in Sugar Land, Texas, United States, on February 16, 2009; previously it was headquartered in the 2000 St. James Place building in Houston.</p>
<a id="Ciel"></a><h4>Ciel</h4>
	<p>Ciel is a purified, noncarbonated bottled water that has been enjoyed by consumers since 1996. Ciel Mineralizada, a bottled mineral water, became available in Mexico in 2001. Ciel is a brand of bottled water owned by The Coca-Cola Company which is bottled and sold in Mexico, Angola, and Morocco. Coca-Cola Mexico introduced Ciel in 1996 in the states of Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Zacatecas, Durango, San Luis Potosi and Coahuila.
In 1997 Ciel was released in Mexico City, and in 2001 was released in the states of Nuevo Leon and part of Tamaulipas. In that same year, The Coca-Cola Company released a club soda version called Ciel Mineralizada in several markets.
In 2002, along with the acquisition of Panamerican Beverages (Panamco) made by Coca-Cola FEMSA, The Coca-Cola Company acquired Panamco's bottled water brand Risco, and converted it into Ciel, so the brand started being available in the states of Guanajuato, Puebla, Veracruz and Michoacán.
Ciel Aquarius
In 2005 Coca-Cola released a calorie-free flavored water version of Ciel called Ciel Aquarius (renamed Ciel+ in 2008). In that same year, Ciel Dasani was released, a functional water with skin nutrients and fiber available in four flavors: lemon-cucumber, papaya-carrot, grapefruit and mandarin-green tea; a year later, this product was discontinued.

In 2006 The Coca-Cola Company released Ciel Naturae, a line of sparkling flavored water available in three flavors: Jamaica, Peach and Lemon. In 2007 the product was renamed as Ciel Finamente Gasificada and later in 2008 was replaced by a new sparkling water line called Aquarius.

In 2007 Ciel became available in the cities of Saltillo and Monclova in Coahuila and Matehuala in San Luis Potosí. In that same year, Grupo Tampico bottlers in Tampico, Ciudad Valles, Poza Rica, Ciudad Mante and Ciudad Victoria replaced the purified water and club soda versions of its brand Peña Pura and turned them into Ciel; plus, CIMSA, the Coca-Cola bottling company in Toluca merged its bottled water brand De los Angeles with Ciel and renamed it as De los Angeles por Ciel and later as Ciel De Los Angeles. The De Los Angeles trademark is still property of CIMSA. At the end of 2008, Coca-Cola acquired Manantial Water from Grupo Yoli and became part of the Ciel lineup.

However, the exact amount of fruit juices per 547 ml bottle is unclear due to the product label, which presents medicinal and non-medicinal ingredients in separate lists; this information is also absent from the Fuze product website. It has been estimated that Fuze beverages contain between 1.0% and 5.0% actual fruit content.[

Fuze's Slenderize line of products has the widest selection of flavors, and it is implied that these products will assist in weight loss either by satisfying a dieter's cravings for sweets or by incorporating the drink into a more filling smoothie mix using fresh fruit and yogurt.[13] However, to date there is no scientific evidence to support these claims or other previous assertions that Fuze products may help consumers avoid cancer, heart disease, colds, flu, and infections of the lungs and kidneys.[ </p>
